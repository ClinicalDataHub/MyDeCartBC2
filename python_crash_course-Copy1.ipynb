    "The Greek philosopher Pythagoras reportedly said, \"All is number!\". Deep down in the computer, Pythagoras is correct but in this course we are primarily going to think of data as consisting of **strings** and **numbers**. Adopting a physical metaphor, we can say that numbers and strings are our atoms of data. We can then combine numbers and strings to create molecules of data.\n",

    "1. Methods: Methods are functions that operate on the characteristics (data) of the object (Think verbs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important components of the programs we will be writing are **data objects** and **function objects.** Using a biology analogy, data objects are like the blood circulating through our bodies and function objects are like our organs that take blood in and return modified blood and some biological behavior.\n",
